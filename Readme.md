# Function Composition
# ======================
 1. We can use a function composition to build a house by combining the functions of each step.

2. Step 1: create function 1 => It will be building the building's base.

3. Step 2: create function 2 => It will be on next step which come after the base creation , that is walls creation.

4. Step 3: create function 3  => It is the about adding roof.

5. Here each function return something like in 1st function it returns "base created", Now for next function it takes previous output with its input. And for last function it also takes it's previous function's utpout and combines with its own input. 

6. Last functionis created which calls each function in sequence to build a house.At the end each step is combined.
